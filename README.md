# Machine Learning Model Training - Hospital Data

This project uses a Random Forest Classifier to train a model on hospital data. The objective is to predict patient outcomes based on various medical features.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Python 3.8+**
   - Download from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
   - To verify:  
     ```bash
     python --version
     ```

2. **pip (Python Package Installer)**
   - Comes with Python by default.
   - To verify:  
     ```bash
     pip --version
     ```

3. **Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab**
   - Recommended way to run `.ipynb` files.
   - Install via pip:
     ```bash
     pip install notebook
     ```

## 📦 Install Dependencies

Once Python is installed, install the required Python libraries:

## 📂 Project Files
model_training.ipynb – Main notebook file to run training

hospital_data.csv – Dataset file (must be in the same folder as the notebook)
model.pkl – File generated after training, containing the saved ML model


```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jobl
